    "longDescription": "A many-to-many relationship between two tables can be established by creating a table typically called a bridge/junction/join table and adding foreign-key constraints from it to the original tables. These are then tracked using Hasura. \n \nIn this example, we'll be creating tables for `article` and `tag`, and then a bridge table names `article_tag`. \n \nThese two tables are related via a many-to-many relationship. i.e: \n \n- an `article` can have many `tags` \n- a `tag` can have many `articles`",
